Repository for the entire class    

# Instructions
1. Per group, create a folder with its name based on your tables     
2. Add your files into the folder
3. Files need to be named as yourtablenames_main.py, yourtablenames_interface.py or yourtablenames_gui.py, and yourtablenames_database.py (Abbreviations for names are fine)
4. Do not touch anything outside of your group's folder
       
An example for file naming is "sched_exec_main.py"
